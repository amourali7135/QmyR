Congratulations on signing up for QmyR!  You will now be able to keep in better touch with your business + personal connections!
<br>
Before proceeding, please first create either a business profile or a personal profile:
<br>
After you make one of the profiles, you can make the other one from your dashboard.
<br>
In order for the app to work properly, please make both profiles, even if you intend to only use one of them!
<h5><strong>Important!  At the current early stage of development, the app is not present in the Apple store or any Android store platforms!</strong></h5>
<br>
<h5><strong>To have this app on your phone:  For iOS users:  On Safari, click the share button on the bottom middle portion of the browser, then select Add To Home Screen</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>For Android users:  Once the app has loaded, click on the add to homescreen shortcut on Firefox, or click on menu dots, then Add to homescreen for Chrome</strong></h5>
